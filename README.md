**Specification of implemented functions**

- The **player** function should take a board state as input, and return which playerâ€™s turn it is (either X or O).

- The **actions** function should return a set of all of the possible actions that can be taken on a given board.

- The **winner** function should accept a board as input, and return the winner of the board if there is one.

- The **terminal** function should accept a board as input, and return a boolean value indicating whether the game is over.
